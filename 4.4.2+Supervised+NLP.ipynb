    "Supervised NLP requires a pre-labelled dataset for training and testing, and is generally interested in categorizing text in various ways. In this case, we are going to try to predict whether a sentence comes from _Alice in Wonderland_ by Lewis Carroll or _Persuasion_ by Jane Austen. We can use any of the supervised models we've covered previously, as long as they allow categorical outcomes. In this case, we'll try Random Forests, SVM, and KNN.\n",
